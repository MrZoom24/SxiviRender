# SxiviRender

**SxiviRender** is a C++ ray tracer named after the Georgian word for "ray" (სხივი). 
This project began as an implementation of Peter Shirley's *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* and is being evolved with performance optimizations and advanced features.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Core Math & Basic Sphere Rendering
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Materials (Matte, Metal, Glass)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Performance (Multi-threading with C++20)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Custom Geometry (Triangles and Meshes)

## 🛠️ Build Requirements
- C++20 Compiler (GCC or Clang)
- CMake 3.10+
